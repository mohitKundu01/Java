# Java
Learning java from GFG 

#Intro
-> Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in the year 1995.
-> Java is a class based, object-oriented programming language
-> A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write  once run anywhere that
   is compiled  java code can run on all platforms that support  Java.
-> Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine.
-> Java application are called WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere).

### Implementation of java application programs involve:-
1. Creating the program - Create a program using Text Editor.
2. Compiling the program
3. Running the program




## JDK in java
(JDK - Java Development Kit)

JDK = JRE + Developments Tools
JRE = JVM + Library Classes

JVM = Java Virtual Machine
JRE = Java Runtime Environment


NOTE :
     - Confusing in JDK and JRE(also called Private Runtime)
     - If you are only interested in running Java Programs on your machine then you can easily
       do it using JRE.
     - If you would like to develop a Java-based software application then JDK is required.
     

## JVM (Java Virtual Machine )
-> JVM acts as a run-time engine to run java application.
-> It is the only that calls the main method  present in java code.
-> Java application also called WORA (Write Once Run AnyWhere).
-> A programmer can develop Java Code on one system and can expect it to run on any other 
   java-enabled system without any adjustment. This is possible because of JVM.
